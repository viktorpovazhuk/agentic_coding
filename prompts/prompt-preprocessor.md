Write script that will accept long prompt in a form of sentence and use GPT-5 API to split it in multiple simple prompts. Input prompt describes object that we need to detect using Grounding DINO model. For example, "Find the tall person in a red jacket near a bicycle, holding a blue ball". As Grounding DINO can't handle such long prompt correctly, we need to split it in shorted prompts of 2 types: visual and spatial.
