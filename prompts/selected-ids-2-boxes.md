Create a script ids2boxes py in @data that will load specified csv with  selected boxes (e.g. "/datasets2/datasets/aeroscapes/Processed/selected_boxes.csv"), and csv with filtered samples (e.g. "/datasets2/datasets/aeroscapes/Processed/filtered_view.csv") and combine them in json file containing samples with selected boxes.
Overall json file structure is the next: {"samples": {"<img_filename_stem>": {"filename": "<img_filename>", "boxes": [[x1, y1, x2, y2], [...], [...]]}}}. So, for each sample script must create json object. If there were some selected boxes, "boxes" property should be populated with coordinates of these boxes. If no, then "boxes" property should be just empty list. Not selected boxes should be just dropped.
Selected boxes ids are specified in "selected_boxes.csv" in column "boxes_ids" as indices of elements from the list of boxes. List of boxes for corresponding sample is specified in "filtered_view.csv" in column "boxes" in already correct format [x1, y1, x2, y2]. Class id from "filtered_view.csv" should be dropped.
Output json should be saved in specified json file (e.g. /datasets2/datasets/aeroscapes/Processed/samples_filtered_boxes.json).
Read corresponding csv files and adjust code of generated script to handle them properly.
